# Attribution and Use of AI Tools

This project makes use of AI assistants and code generation tools to support development, including:

## Tools Used

- **ChatGPT by OpenAI (GPT-4o)**: Assisted in refining Python code, structuring the project, debugging Streamlit application behavior, and suggesting improvements.
- **Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3**: Used as the core language model for summarization, question answering, and content analysis features.
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: Open-source PDF parsing library used for document ingestion and text extraction.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create the frontend interface for the application.

## AI Contributions

- AI tools helped generate:
  - Prompt structures for Claude 3 summarization
  - Code refactoring and error handling strategies

## Authorship Responsibility

Although AI tools assisted in generating portions of the code and documentation, the overall project design, writing, integration, testing, and final implementation were conducted and verified by the project author. All AI-generated content was reviewed and modified to fit the project goals and context.
